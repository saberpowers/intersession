Retrosheet: Retrosheet (retrosheet.org) is a non-profit founded in 1989 to
compile a complete record of historical MLB box scores and play-by-play
accounts. Volunteers have undertaken a massive effort to collect play-by-play
event files going as far back as 1921 and box scores going as far back as 1871.
This CSV file includes every play from the 2016 MLB regular season.

Statcast: Statcast is a camera tracking system introduced by MLB Advanced Media
to all 30 MLB ballparks in 2015. Most of the data, which include the location
of all players and the ball at many frames per second, are not available to the
public, but summary statistics like pitch spin rate, hit exit velocity and hit
launch angle, are available for download at baseballsavant.com. This CSV file
includes exit velocity and launch angle for every tracked ball from April
through July (4 months) of the 2016 MLB regular season.
